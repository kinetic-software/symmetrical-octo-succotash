# Senior C# Backend Test Repo

The task
This is a very badly designed code. Your task is to refactor the solution and document your intentions.
If you can't fit in the given timeframe, we will evaluate your intentions and any WIP you check in.

Keep in mind that this is an incomplete service. Our future requirements include a search endpoint, and
processing event driven data updates following our CQRS design.
